Project title: DJ Date App
The primary aim of this project was to develop "DJ Date," a novel dating app that connects users based 
on the musical key and tempo of songs they upload. Here's a breakdown of the app's concept and 
functionality:
1. User Uploads: Users upload a song to the app, which then uses an algorithm to determine the 
key and tempo.
2. Musical Matching: The app matches users whose songs are in the same key and tempo. This 
allows for a unique shared listening experience when the app plays both songs simultaneously 
upon a match.
3. Experience for Users: This feature is designed to be intriguing for musicians who can explore 
harmonies and for non-musicians who enjoy novel musical experiences.
Challenges and Adaptations:
 Streaming vs. Ownership: The transition from MP3 ownership to music streaming platforms like 
Spotify presents challenges, as these platforms do not provide direct access to audio files, 
necessary for our matching algorithm.
 API Constraints: Integrating with music streaming services would require managing API usage 
and user authorization, introducing significant complexity.
 Song Database: Establishing a comprehensive database of songs categorized by key and tempo 
is challenging. Although services like Tunebat.com allow searches for songs with similar 
attributes, they do not offer access to actual audio files.
 Copyright Concerns: The project must navigate copyright laws, which restrict the use of audio 
files, limiting the scope for testing and deployment.
Current Scope:
In its current stage, the project focuses on developing a basic interface that allows users to upload songs 
and automatically detect their key and tempo. This simplified version will serve as the groundwork for 
testing the key and tempo detection algorithms and improving the user interface.
